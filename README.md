# Unsupervised Learning Project
## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running
### Print Usage
Print usage using:
```bash
python unsupervised.py
```
### Comparing Dimension Reduction and Number of Clusters
Compare dimensions from 5 to 18 using ICA or PCA, clusters from 2 to 18 using KMeans, GMM or DBscan (run differently).
```bash
python unsupervised.py comparison
```
### Running Clustering with Optimal Values
ICA algorithm with 7 dimensions, and K-Means algorithm with 5 clusters. Plot in 2D using T-SNE and UMap.
```bash
python unsupervised.py comparison
```
